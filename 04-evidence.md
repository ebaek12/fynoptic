# Proof beats opinions: a minimal evidence routine

## What to capture, always
- the before/after screen; the totals; your action; any confirmation.

## Where to store it
- a single folder per merchant; consistent filenames; cloud backup if possible.

## Time anchors
- why dates on screenshots matter; how to include the system clock in captures.

## Privacy
- avoid exposing full card digits; redact with the built-in tool (simple overlay boxes).

## When to stop arguing and escalate
- after one clean request + one dated follow-up.

// and a module-level QUESTIONS bank) into src/hooks/usePracticeSession.ts as
// real exported functions (QUESTIONS becomes an explicit first parameter to
// createSession; drawQuestion drops the updateDiffChip DOM write, elided
// below). These tests now import that real module instead of the
// byte-for-byte copy Phase 1d pinned this file with — same algorithm, same
// assertions, no copy left to drift. Appendix A is the exact contract these
// tests pin.

// Real drawQuestion no longer calls updateDiffChip — DOM chrome with no
// bearing on the session state these tests pin (Session.tsx renders
// session.currentDiff directly instead of that imperative write).

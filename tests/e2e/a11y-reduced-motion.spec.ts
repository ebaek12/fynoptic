// Runs only under the `chromium-reduced-motion` Playwright project (see
// playwright.config.ts), which sets a real `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`
// context — closer to how a user's OS setting reaches the page than a
// per-test `page.emulateMedia()` call.
//
// The Direction B spec (§6.3 "Degradation") cites an audit finding of
// "10/14 elements on /courses stuck at opacity:0 under reduced motion."
// Reproducing that today: `redesign.css`'s `@media (prefers-reduced-motion:
// reduce) { * { animation: none !important } }` disables the `.fade-up`
// keyframe animation that would otherwise raise these elements to
// opacity:1, and courses.astro never calls `initReveal()` (only
// index.astro does) to add the compensating `.in-view` class the way
// index.astro's reveal elements get. Empirically, though, every element
// matching the reveal-class selector set below already resolves to
// opacity:1 on every page in this build — this spec pins that (good)
// current state as a regression guard, since it is the exact thing a
// future change to this CSS/JS could silently break.

// `.why-card` / `.slab-item` were the old `.why-slab` section's item class
// names — that section was deleted in Phase 7 (rack-focus rewrite), so those
// two class names no longer exist anywhere in the DOM. Dropped here in favor
// of the classes/attributes Phase 7's replacement (RackFocus) actually
// emits: `[role="tab"]` + `#rack-tabpanel` cover its reduced-motion tablist
// fallback (also matches the hero Ticket's tabs, which is a bonus, not a
// regression), and `[data-rack-name]` / `[data-rack-panel]` cover the
// pinned-track markup in case a future change ever renders it under reduced
// motion.

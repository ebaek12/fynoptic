# Module 1 intro (90–120 words)

Most websites are optimized to move you along a path: sign up faster, add more to cart, keep you from leaving. Dark patterns appear where those goals collide with your intent. In this course you’ll learn a fast scan—defaults, wording shifts, timing—and a handful of counter-moves that work under pressure. You’ll see real patterns, practice quick identification, and leave with a lightweight routine for proof. No jargon, no giant checklists. The point is speed: name the pattern, act once in the right channel, save proof, set a deadline. That’s how regular people win these everyday fights.

## A fast scan method that works

Scan the three hot zones: sign-up (consent boxes, defaults), checkout (fees, pre-checked add-ons), cancellation (channel friction, pauses).

### The 60-second pass:

- **Defaults:** anything pre-checked or hidden behind “More options.”
- **Wording shifts:** “pause” vs “cancel,” “store credit” vs “refund,” vague “manage plan.”
- **Timing:** renewal windows, notice periods, return cutoffs.

**Decision pivot:** If you spot one tactic, assume there are two—re-scan for a second issue before acting.

**Act + capture:** Choose the correct route (opt-out / cancel / pay once / leave & compare) and screenshot before and after states.

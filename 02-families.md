# The field guide: what it is, how to spot it, what to do

**Structure:**  
Definition in one sentence.  
Typical placement (sign-up/checkout/cancel).  
Spotting cues (2–3 concrete tells).  
Counter-move (fastest path that leaves a trail).

## Example (Obstruction)

**Definition:** Adds friction to block your intended path—extra steps, narrow hours, disappearing options.  
**Placement:** cancellation, refunds, account deletion.  
**Cues:** phone-only cancel; weekday hours; “please chat with us to continue.”  
**Counter-move:** use the required channel once (to avoid “you never asked”); state a clear, dated request; save a timestamped record; set a follow-up date; if blocked, escalate with the proof.

## Example (Sneaking)

**Definition:** Adds cost or consent without clear disclosure.  
**Placement:** checkout add-ons, warranty boxes, email sharing.  
**Cues:** pre-checked upsells; add-ons that appear in cart line items; opt-outs hidden in submenus.  
**Counter-move:** remove add-ons; take a cart screenshot; proceed only if total reflects your intent; if charged, your screenshot supports refund.

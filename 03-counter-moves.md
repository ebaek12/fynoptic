# Counter-moves that actually work
You don’t have to argue for hours. Most situations fold when you use the right action at the right moment and keep a paper trail. Start with permission hygiene—turn off marketing, uncheck defaults, ask for confirmations. If you’re canceling, send a concise, dated request through the required channel once, then follow with email. When a refund stalls, quote their policy, attach your proof, give a clear deadline. If it still drags, escalate to the platform or payment rails with the same evidence. That rhythm closes loops without drama.

## Opt-out & permission hygiene

- How to locate email/ad/consent centers quickly (search terms: “privacy,” “communications,” “data”).
- The principle of mirrored proof: a screenshot of settings before and after, plus confirmation email.
- When to create a throwaway email for trials; when to refuse card-up-front trials.

## Cancel decisively (the four elements of a request)

**The 2-sentence template:**

- **Sentence 1:** “I am requesting immediate cancellation of account #ID/email as of YYYY-MM-DD.”
- **Sentence 2:** “Confirm by reply that no further charges will occur and provide written confirmation.”

- Why “pause” or “downgrade” isn’t equivalent; how to decline it concisely.
- Phone-only cancel: how to read a script, ask for a reference number, and send a follow-up email that documents the call.

## Refunds, credits, and proration—what to ask for first

- Refund vs store credit; when each is practical; proration cutoffs.
- “Policy echo” method: quote the merchant’s own policy line and attach your timestamped action.
- What to do if they cite a renewal lock—the exception angle.

## Escalation ladders that move cases

- Sequence: merchant channel → platform (app store/marketplace) → payment rails (card/PayPal/BNPL policy) → regulator complaint.
- Two-paragraph demand note that avoids legalese; firm deadline; clean attachments list.

## Proof that sticks

- The “Four Ps”: page, price, plan, proof (screenshots show the page; the total price; the plan you chose; the proof of your action).
- How to name files for clarity: YYYYMMDD_platform_action_topic.png.
